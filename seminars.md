## Week 1 - Introduction: Spaces of History

This first orientation session will offer you an overview of the module and its assessments. We will then have a discussion about what spatial history is, and hear a bit from each student about their main interests and goals for the year.

*Overview:*
 
1. I’m going to go over the structure of the module and assessments
2. We will have a discussion about spatial history and what it is.
3. We will discuss a few concrete examples of spatial history
4. We will discuss your ideas of spaces that we may turn the attention of our historical analysis to
5. We will look at some previous student work in this module and discuss the central importance of finding primary sources to work with
 
*Please read:*

## Week 2: Treaty Ports, Leased Territories, and Foreign Concessions

Today we will explore the unique spaces that are treaty ports, leased territories, and foreign concessions, which will play an important role in shaping life and interactions in the period this module focuses on. The readings will focus most heavily on China, most of all Shanghai, but they were important in Japan and Korea as well. 

**Task**

1. Using the Rumsey Map collection:

http://www.davidrumsey.com/

Find a map of a city in East or Southeast Asia from 1850-1950 that you find interesting. Print it out or bring it in on your laptop/tablet for us to look at and be prepared to discuss what you think we can learn about the city from it. You can create a printable version with the "Export" button visible when viewing a map in the website's viewer.

## Week 3 - Historical and Theoretical Approaches to Space

This week will introduce you to the approaches to space and place of several influential spatial theorists.

**Task**

1. This week is a challenging one. Be ready to answer questions about what certain difficult keywords mean, and what certain challenging sentences may have meant. As you read these theoretical texts, you may not find all of it useful or without contradiction but read with a sympathetic approach, asking yourself what might be helpful take aways from this that may come to help guide you as you read about cities in more concrete scholarship.
2. We are focusing on the theoretical perspectives of three individuals in particular: Henri Lefebvre, Doreen Massey, and Michel de Certeau. Be able to say something about the relationship between these thinkers with regards to their understand of space. What do they have in common, and where do they diverge?

## Week 4 - Urban Planning

This week we will explore two of the major urban planning movements and then consider the ways in which urban planning adapts to the colonial setting, especially in the British empire. We'll consider some of the examples where the ambitions of urban planners come into conflict with the realities of urban life in East and Southeast Asia.

**Primary Sources:**

1. We are going to discuss the early plans for Singapore, including "Raffles Plan" or the "Jackson Plan". See [this resource](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_658_2005-01-07.html#) and [this map](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/maps_building_plans/record-details/f9926418-115c-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad).

2. We will also devote some class time to thinking about the range of sources that we can use to explore the urban planning in cities throughout East and Southeast Asia, especially when there are language limitations. We'll do group work for this task.

## Week 6 - Independent Learning Week

There is no meeting in Independent Learning Week but this a very important time for you to make progress on your long essay: a time for reading, refining, or a time for a shift in direction if your initial ideas are not fruitful. Especially important is to give yourself to browse primary sources and allow for potentially useful discoveries. You can also use this time to catch up on any readings you may not have good notes for.

**Primary Sources and Activities**

- *In class:* We will explore some maps and housing plans in East and Southeast Asia in class and analyse them in light of our reading this week.
