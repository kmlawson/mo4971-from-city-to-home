## Week 1: Treaty Ports, Leased Territories, and Foreign Concessions

Today we will explore the unique spaces that are treaty ports, leased territories, and foreign concessions, which will play an important role in shaping life and interactions in the period this module focuses on. The readings will focus most heavily on China, most of all Shanghai, but they were important in Japan and Korea as well. 

**Task**

1. Using the Rumsey Map collection:

http://www.davidrumsey.com/

Find a map of a city in East or Southeast Asia from 1850-1950 that you find interesting. Print it out or bring it in on your laptop/tablet for us to look at and be prepared to discuss what you think we can learn about the city from it. You can create a printable version with the "Export" button visible when viewing a map in the website's viewer.

## Week 2 - Historical and Theoretical Approaches to Space

**Task**

1. This week is a challenging one. Be ready to answer questions about what certain difficult keywords mean, and what certain challenging sentences may have meant. As you read these theoretical texts, you may not find all of it useful or without contradiction but read with a sympathetic approach, asking yourself what might be helpful take aways from this that may come to help guide you as you read about cities in more concrete scholarship.
2. We are focusing on the theoretical perspectives of three individuals in particular: Henri Lefebvre, Doreen Massey, and Michel de Certeau. Be able to say something about the relationship between these thinkers with regards to their understand of space. What do they have in common, and where do they diverge?

## Week 6 - Independent Learning Week

There is no meeting in Independent Learning Week but this a very important time for you to make progress on your long essay: a time for reading, refining, or a time for a shift in direction if your initial ideas are not fruitful. Especially important is to give yourself to browse primary sources and allow for potentially useful discoveries. You can also use this time to catch up on any readings you may not have good notes for.

### Winter Break

Over winter break, please read the following book:

Calvino, Italo *Invisible Cities* - It is a short but powerful work, available in cheap paperback, set as a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. Each chapter is no more than a few pages, and some are a single paragraph.

Also, please choose one of the following, read a bit on their background, and read some of their stories, available in cheap paperback:  
Eileen Chang (for example *Love in a Fallen City: And Other Stories* or *Lust, Caution: And Other Stories*)  
Edogawa Rampo (for example *Japanese Tales of Mystery and Imagination* or *The Edogawa Rampo Reader*)  

Take note of the ways in which urban environment and domestic spaces are described. How can literature help open up a world for historians in the studies of these?

### Semester 2 Readings

- These will be udpated for January, 2022.
