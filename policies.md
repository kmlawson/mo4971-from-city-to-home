The Semester Dates are available at:  

[Semester Dates](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/semesterdates/)

### Marking Scale

Please refer to the School of History website for assessment for information on the honours marking scale:

[Assessment - School of History](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/students/ug/assessment/)

### Absence from Classes

Attendance is a basic assessment requirement for credit award, and failure to attend classes or meetings with academic staff may result in your losing the right to be assessed in that module. 

Please read the university policy on self-certification of student absences:

[Self-certification of Absence](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/students/rules/selfcertification/)

### Disability Support

The University provides support for students who declare a disability both at entry to their course and whilst on course.  If you are an entrant then we can start the process of putting arrangements in place before you start your studies and we would recommend that you contact the Disability Team as soon as you have made an application to study here.  The University has a range of reasonable adjustments that it can put in place for you to help you achieve your academic potential and to make the transition to University as smooth as possible.

Please see the School of History guidelines for details about other relevant policies related to late, long (but see assessment descriptions for word ranges) or short work as well as details about extensions:

### Emails

If you have a question that requires an answer with significant detail, please consider asking during office hours, or at the beginning or end of class. Please avoid sending emails that require more than a very brief answer. If the email requires a substantive answer, I may ask you to bring the question up again after our next class or in office hours. I will strive to offer a reply to emails received within 48 hours, whenever possible. Emails are usually not responded to over the weekend and may not even be read until Monday. In writing emails, please try to be clear about what you are asking, and keep in mind that your message is one among many from students of multiple classes and differing contexts. Please mention which course you are in and what specific matter you are referring to. As in class, feel free to address me by first name in emails. Finally, before hitting the send button, please confirm that the answer to your question is not found in the handbook, on official school websites, or other handouts provided to the class.

### Laptops in Class

Recent studies are increasingly showing that, for whatever reasons, the handwriting of notes, and the reading of essays on physical paper as opposed to computers or other reading devices increases the quality of notes, significantly boosts recall, and better processing of content in general.

There are, however, many benefits to using a laptop for notes, and keeping reading content in digital form, not the least ready access, easy distribution, ability to re-sort notes, searchability, and for those who have handwriting as poor as mine: simple readability.

You are welcome to bring a laptop to class and use it for notes and reading. If you do not bring a laptop, I ask that you bring either printed or photocopied copies of assigned reading that is made available every week or else good notes so that you can easily refer to the readings as we discuss them. It is especially important that you have copies of assigned primary sources with you and not bringing them makes for very ineffective use of a seminar that is based on the discussion of reading.

Please do not to use applications on your laptop not related to our class, including email applications and social media. Obviously they will interfere with your own concentration but that is not the primary concern: using other applications on your laptop is a severe distraction to anyone sitting next to you.

### Collective Notes

I believe in the benefits of sharing notes, not only with your classmates, but with future potential students of the class. For this purpose, I have created, and will provide the link for a Google document where you can post readings, organize reference material and online links to info and sources, etc. throughout the semester. I will also provide a link to notes from previous years (which may include some different readings and seminar topics). Both present and past years should be treated as you might any historical source: you should not use them to replace your own reading and note taking, and you should not treat content and notes provided by others as something you can uncritically accept as accurate. Use them as a productive supplement, as an alternative perspective as you conduct your own studies.

### Academic Misconduct and Plagiarism

Academic integrity is fundamental to the values promoted by the University. It is important that all students are judged on their ability, and that no student is allowed unfairly to take an advantage over others, to affect the security and integrity of the assessment process, or to diminish the reliability and quality of a St Andrews degree. Academic misconduct includes *inter alia* the presentation of material as one's own when it is not one's own; the presentation of material whose provenance is academically inappropriate; and academically inappropriate behaviour in an examination or class test. 

**Note on use of Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Large Language Models such as ChatGPT, Bard, Claude, etc. are powerful tools that generate confident answers to user prompts. LLMs frequently produce blatantly, or sometimes more subtly false information, are unable to effectively preserve their train of thought, and susceptible to sometimes hilarious logical flaws as a result of their innate design. We are all in the process of adapting to the emergence of LLMs and any potential place in our research and writing. The wholesale generation of paragraphs of prose by an LLM for submission is not permitted and is a violation of the rules of academic practice. Students are expected to submit their own original work and are responsible for all errors of fact and reasoning. *You cannot trust anything an LLM tells you and must confirm the veracity of any historical claims it offers you.* The limited use of LLMs as part of your research and editing process is permitted (but is not recommended unless you are fully aware of their shortcomings) for the following purposes: 1) Their use in the early brainstorming stage as you are testing out ideas, making lists of possible avenues, and asking for broad overviews of topics to generate concrete hooks for more targeted research in more accurate sources. 2) To brainstorm possible structures for your writing 3) To solicit critiques of your writing at the sentence or paragraph level. 4) For suggestions on alternative phrasing. Again, for all the above points, you cannot assume LLM responses will be accurate, but asking for a range of possible responses may give you or trigger further useful ideas. Any shortcomings of your work are ultimately yours alone.

If you are unsure about the correct presentation of academic material, you should approach your tutor. You can also make use of the resources of CEED, which provides an extensive range of training on Academic Skills.
