### Description	

This module explores the spatial histories of nineteenth- and twentieth-century East and South East Asia from the scale of the urban to the domestic. Students will study the history of Asian cities in colonial, semi-colonial, and early post-colonial contexts. Using travel accounts, newspapers, colonial records, police archives, literature, maps, and other images, students will use primary sources to analyse historical change in the spaces of everyday life such as the home, parks, transportation networks, department stores, and teahouses.

### Learning Outcomes

* To gain the ability to analyse a variety of primary sources that each pose particular challenges and serious limitations in accessing a broad range of perspectives in the histories of East and Southeast Asian cities and spaces.
* To develop the ability to balance the need for deep empirical research that appreciates rich local contexts while answering historical problems that explore comparative, transnational, and global connections.
* To apply interdisciplinary approaches to spatial history from the scale of the city to the home.
