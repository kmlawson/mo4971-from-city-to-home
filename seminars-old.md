## Seminars

**Please Note**: We have an [online reading list](https://rl.talis.com/3/sta/lists/AF829C50-640A-3848-602B-0CD24E888B64.html?lang=en-GB) for the module for your convenience but it is harder to read, is sometimes missing texts, and does not include specific tasks that I set for your preparation. Always work from the handbook as you prepare your readings but you can check for ebook versions etc. with the digital reading list. Again: this handbook is the canonical version of your preparation guidelines, not the sometimes incorrect online reading list.
 

### Week 0 - Urban History and Spatial History

You don't need to do any preparatory reading for our first meeting, which will only be one hour. Come with some thoughts about what "spatial history" might be, and what your understanding of space and place are. We will have introductions and then a discussion of some of these issues. We'll look over the structure of the module as a whole.

**Optional Background Reading**

You can also use this time to catch up on any readings you may not have good notes for.

### Winter Break

Over winter break, please read the following book:

Calvino, Italo *Invisible Cities* - It is a short but powerful work, available in cheap paperback, set as a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. Each chapter is no more than a few pages, and some are a single paragraph.

Also, please choose one of the following, read a bit on their background, and read some of their stories, available in cheap paperback:  
Eileen Chang (for example *Love in a Fallen City: And Other Stories* or *Lust, Caution: And Other Stories*)  
Edogawa Rampo (for example *Japanese Tales of Mystery and Imagination* or *The Edogawa Rampo Reader*)  

Take note of the ways in which urban environment and domestic spaces are described. How can literature help open up a world for historians in the studies of these?
